  <p>I am a student of Systems Analysis and
Development at Centro Universit√°rio
Braz Cubas, with a degree in
Electrotechnology from SENAI.
Currently, I work as an IT intern at
Sanofi. My major aspiration is to
become a Software Developer, and I am
seeking to specialize in Full-Stack
development. I have solid knowledge in
programming logic, Front-end and
Back-end technologies, Test-Driven
Development (TDD), problem-solving,
and advanced English proficiency. I am
enthusiastic about contributing to
collaborative teams in a proactive
manner and committed to adopting an
agile mindset for development.
